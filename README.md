# Gym-Math-Calculator
Gym Math Calculator is a simple but useful tool I built to help track progress in the gym. Whether you’re loading a barbell, trying to guess your one-rep max, or figuring out if you should go up in dumbbell weight — this app does the math for you.  I built it using just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
